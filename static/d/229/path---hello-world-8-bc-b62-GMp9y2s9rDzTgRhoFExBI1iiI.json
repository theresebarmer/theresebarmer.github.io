The one thing keeping me from it\nwas the time factor. Initially I planned on building something from scratch, but since there\nare really good alternatives out there (such as Gatsby, which is what I ended up using),\nthere is no shame in using these.</p>\n<p>I am quite new, or so I think anyways, to development. I started a vocational college in 2014, a two year program which ended in a degree as a certified web developer in .Net. I started working right after graduation and was thrown into a project where the stack consisted of React for the frontend and C# for the backend(this was later rewritten in Node).
