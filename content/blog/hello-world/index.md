I have planned on starting a blog for such a long time. The one thing keeping me from it
was the time factor. Initially I planned on building something from scratch, but since there
are really good alternatives out there (such as Gatsby, which is what I ended up using),
there is no shame in using these.

I am quite new, or so I think anyways, to development. I started a vocational college in 2014, a two year program which ended in a degree as a certified web developer in .Net. I started working right after graduation and was thrown into a project where the stack consisted of React for the frontend and C# for the backend(this was later rewritten in Node). With three weeks of JavaScript under my belt it was daunting. But I managed to survive and have been working with JavaScript ever since.
